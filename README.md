This is a project collecting programming strategies.

##How do I contribute a new programming strategy?
1. Create a new page with a .md markdown extension.
2. Write up your programming strategy. Pages are built using Markdown. [See how](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). You can add **formatting**, make 
lists, add absolute links, and add \[relative links\](yourpage.md).
3. Add a relative link to your programming strategy to index.md.
