This is a project to collect strategies for programming.

### How can I contribute a programming strategy?
1. Click on Create a new file and name your file with .md markdown extension.
2. Edit the new file (you can use the text editor in Github), and write up your programming strategy. Pages are built using Markdown. [See how](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). You can add **formatting**, make 
lists, add absolute links, and add \[relative links\](yourpage.md).
3. Add a relative link to your programming strategy to index.md.
